title: In Between
---

In between is a feeling. It's a state that I'm constantly at bay. It is a literal and figurative speech of those spending times studying abroad.

It's a feeling that is difficult to grasp and understood on my own. It's a feeling that pops up during hangouts, even with the people you care the most. It's a sudden jolt that brings you back to reality while going out on a Saturday night in NYC. What am I doing here? On these unfamiliar streets, where people passing by barely resemble my skintones or my accent. Where am I heading? With the people I may just meet, a few months in. What am I speaking? A language that's so foreign to me yet become part of my identity. I'm not sure. I'm in between.

I feel in between New York and Hanoi. In between a city that never sleeps and a city that shuts its light at 9PM. It has been a few years since I have gone back home. 2 years to be exact. Compared to the previous generation of international students, I am priviledged. My cousin didn't go home 7 years after he arrived. But the feeling I have is indescribable. I am fortunate to study in the U.S since high school. It's interesting to leave my motherland so early, at the age of 15 to study in the U.S. I don't think my identity or personality was formed completely yet, or formed at all. By going in the U.S, my experience was shifted to a new perspective and a new life. Half retains the Vietnamese culture and half adapts to the boarding school environment.

This will be my 7th year in the U.S. Lots has changed since high school. But I haven't been able to shaken the in-between feeling I always have. I am not aware when it creeps up on me. Maybe the day I land, subconciously. Or maybe the day I graduate from high school. It doesn't matter I'm suppose. The in-between state is more present now than I have ever experienced.

I'm not an U.S citizen but I feel like I am. I spent my teenage years here, developing lots of friendships with people across the U.S and internationally. I went to a boarding school, where the majority are from wealthy New England families. Does that make me less or more American than other Americans? I'm not sure.

I'm in between. Am I good enough or am I not good enough? The constant question I ask myself while studying Computer Science. I guess I didn't know what I got myself into. I'm in between. Am I a good friend or a bad one? If I haven't reached out to those I consider friends regularly, does that make me less of a friend to them? I'm not sure. I'm in between. Am I introvert or extrovert? I can't really decide. I'm anxious around people I don't know. I'm awkward and don't know what to say. But I didn't want to hide from the interaction. I'm in between. Living here. Making money here. Speaking the language here. Paying my taxes here. But I'm not feeling I'm part of it. Part of this society. One that's so foreign but slowly becomes the closest things I can call home while my original one is far away. I'm in between. Insecure about my abilities and questioning every decision I make. I'm in between. Because I know I should be happy for my friends yet so self-aware of my lack of skills to achieve more. I'm in between. Whether a decision is the right one or not. I'm in between. If I can make it or can I?

In-between. A feeling I have developed recently. It's a mix of melancholy and optimistism. Scared of what yet to come but hopeful for what might eventually arrive. Maybe that's the feeling we have. On our daily commute to work. Sitting across from another person in the R. Immersing in our own world and judging ourselves while observing the rest of the world moves without us in the equation. Maybe I won't be able to shake it off. But each day, each step, each decision I make, I hope to inch toward a more complete feeling, where I'm no longer in between.
