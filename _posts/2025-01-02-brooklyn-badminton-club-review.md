title: Brooklyn Badminton Club - Asia oasis in the Big Apple
---


Brooklyn Badminton Club is closest it gets to Asia. It's tucked in a warehouse
in Ridgewood, Brooklyn. It's accessible via buses or the L train (plus 13
minutes walk). 

There are 7 courts with badminton carpet covered floor. The lights are annoying
because depending on which side of the court you are on, it can blind you during
the shot. The ceiling is very high, allowing for comfortable high clear.

Due to a mysterious condition, the bird in the club slows down a lot compared to
other places, meaning that clear and lifts usually don't land outside of the
court. Smashes are also easier to defend because the birds don't go as fast. The
space reminds me of Asia because most people who play there aren't American.
Most are immigrants from other countries: Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam,
Bangladesh and China

It costs $20 for open play and $70 for 1 hour of court reservation. Overall,
it's quite reasonable for New York City. The club offers lots of lesson options. 
Arm, who is at the club most of the time, is very dedicated. He works the front
desk and oversees group classes. Group class costs $60 and offers a good 2-hour
badminton workout. The club also offers private lesssons that can be booked
through their portal.
