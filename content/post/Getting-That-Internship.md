It's funny to see my initial summer plan that I made a month ago, which 
I have not accomplished any of the goal I set up other than creating 
personal website. I guess that's still a win situation.

# New Goals
As I started my internship a month ago, I think it will be best
to redesign my goal to be more fitting. 
- [ ] Practicing and preparing for technical interviews
- [ ] Learn full stack JS development
- [ ] Create 1 side project of my own with full stack

# Reflection
I have set up lots of goals for myself lately. But it is as if
the more goals I set up, the less I accomplished. 

My biggest goal that I want is an internship at FAANG or Big N
companies. It is certainly competitive but I do truly want it.
However, each time I try to bring myself to prepare or open
Leetcode, I feel slumped. I didn't want to do it and I am
not totally sure why. 

Starting tomorrow, July 15th, I will prepare for the 
technical interview process from resume review, leetcode 
preparation, algorithms and data structures implementations.
Hopefully, I can achieve this starting tomorrow. 

My goal then for tomorrow will be one leetcode problem or
something similar to it. I don't want to set a goal too
far ahead but rather setting up ones that I can incrementally
do over time.

It is scarry to admit but I think this upcoming year is the final
year which I can achieve an internship. I will pour my effort
into this one last chance this Junior year.

For the side project, I will do something similar to help aid
my technical interviews preparation. It will be similar
to algorithm visualizer but will be simpler and easier to code up.
At least that's the plan for now.
