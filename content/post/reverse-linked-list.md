# Reverse Linked List
## Description
Reverse a singly linked list.

## Solution
We use 2 pointers to store `prev` and `curr`. We then changing the pointers at each iteration until `curr` is `None`

### P.S
I finally resume working on algorithms after a while. Hopefully, I can continue this as a more regular things during the school year
