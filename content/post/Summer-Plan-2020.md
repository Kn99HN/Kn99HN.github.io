Usually I like to write my To Do on the sticky notes application on Mac. But I think it would be nice to update them regularly on my blog post.

# Goal

- [ ] Prepare for technical interviews.
- [ ] Finishing 2 side projects:
    - [ ] Algorithm Implementation, which is different algorithms visualized.
    - [ ] CS-Wiki, which is an open source website for NYU student to gain more understanding of CS classes and review them effectively.
- [ ] Complete the 'Missing CS Semester' course online.
- [ ] Going through more formal verification research papers and materials. 
- [x] Setting up my personal website

# Reflection

I transferred to NYU from UMD starting Fall 2019. I certainly has a lot of doubts going to NYU. Partially, I was not sure of the quality of the CS program. The curriculum appears to have more focus on theoretical and mathematical aspect of computer science, which is not entirely bad. However, I am content with how the year turns out. I took some of the most interesting course at NYU, specifically Dr. Shoup's Algorithms course and Dr. Yang's Programming Language course. Additionally, I was able to find some like-minded peers to help me understand more about not only Computer Science but also Software Engineer. 

Additionally, this year, I applied to around 300 companies. All of which I cold apply, i.e sending my resume through their career website. I manage to hear back from 20-30 companies and eventually receive an offer from Rent the Runway. However, it is cancelled due to COVID-19. But I hope that next year I will have more luck and so will the world.

There are more topics I want to write about and hopefully this is a good start. I will try to keep my goal this summer as up to date as I can!
