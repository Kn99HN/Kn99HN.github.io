# Same Tree
## Description
Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.

## Solution
We check for different cases when either of node and return the boolean value. We then check the current value and recurse on left and right.
