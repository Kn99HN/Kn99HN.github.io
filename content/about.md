Hi, I’m Khanh Nguyen, and this is my website! I’m a Junior at NYU majoring in Computer Science, minor in Mathematics. I am also a member of [BUGS](https://bugs-nyu.github.io/), the Open Source club at NYU. This website is mainly for my own personal use. I will occasionally write blog posts, sometimes technical and sometimes not. Hope you enjoy!
What I’m Doing Now

## What I am doing now

Right now I’m working on a few projects: Schedge, a course API for [Albert](http://albert.nyu.edu/albert_index.html), learning more about programming languages and an incoming SWE Intern at MongoDB!
