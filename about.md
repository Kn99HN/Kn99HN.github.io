Howdy, I’m Khanh Nguyen, and this is my website! I’m a senior at NYU majoring in Computer Science, minor in Mathematics. Previously, I interned at [MongoDB](mongodb.com/) on the Cloud InTel team. Currently, I'm learning about Elixir and different systems-related topics.

I want to start blogging more, both technical and creative writing so I set up this website. Hope you enjoy!
