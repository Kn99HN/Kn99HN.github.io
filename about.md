Howdy, I’m Khanh Nguyen. I’m a senior at NYU majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. Previously, I interned at [MongoDB](mongodb.com/) on the Cloud InTel team. Currently, I'm learning about Elixir and different systems-related topics. I'm also a Teaching Assistant for [CS202: Operating Systems](https://cs.nyu.edu/~mwalfish/classes/21fa/) with professor [Michael Walfish](https://cs.nyu.edu/~mwalfish/)!

I want to start blogging more, both technical and creative writing so I set up this website. Hope you enjoy!
