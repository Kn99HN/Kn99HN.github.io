Howdy, I am a SWE at Google based in Seattle. I'm a recent NYU graduate who studied Computer Science and minor in Math.

As a junior, I was an intern at MongoDB on Cloud InTel team, working on providing database metrics to customers. As a sophomore, I was an intern at Orenda, deploying an analytic and energy usage dashboard to the shareholders. 

At NYU, I was the head TA for CS202: Operating Systems, taught by [Dr. Walfish](https://cs.nyu.edu/~mwalfish/). I also worked closely with [Dr. Sivaraman](https://cs.nyu.edu/~anirudh/) on researching distributed tracing, program synthesis and cloud technology.

Outside of school, I am interested in the open source community. I am fortunate to contribute to these amazing projects:
- [MongoDB Python Driver](pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contributors.html)
- [A statically-typed language that compiles to Erlang and JS](github.com/gleam-lang/gleam)
- [An API for NYU courses](github.com/A1Liu/schedge)

I’m broadly interested in systems-related topics, fullstack development and software usability.

I’m always open to chat! Please send me an email: kh.ng0320@gmail.com.

I want to start blogging more, both technical and creative writing so I set up this website. Hope you enjoy!
